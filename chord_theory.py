    Introduction :
        Chords are a combination of three or more notes. When three notes are combined they are called 'Triads' 
        and four or more are called extended chords.
        All the different types of chords can be made from their Major scale.
        Now, every chord starts off with its root note which is the note that the chord is based on.

     _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
    
    Triads : 
        Most often than not chords are made out of alternate notes of scale. 

        Major Triad (1-3-5) :
            A major triad is the first, third and fifth notes of the major scale of the root note.
            These triads instill a notion of happiness and glee.    

            For example:

            For the C major chord, 
                we take the C major scale

                C D E F G A B C
                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

                and take the root note, C then the third and the fifth relative to the root note which 
                are E and G. 
                C, E, G make up the C major triad.

                Here the third is named and the Major third or Major3rd or 3.
        
        Minor Triad (1-b3-5) :
            A minor triad is the first, third and fifth notes of the natural minor scale of the root note.
            These triads instill a notion of sadness or anger depending on the root note.
            But, to understand it using the major scale lets take an example,

            For the C Minor chord,
                we take the C major scale

                C D E F G A B C
                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

                and here we take First, Minor3rd (or b3) and Fifth. What the b3 means is that we take 
                the half tone below the Major3rd, which in this case would be D#.
                C, D#, G make up the C minor triad.
        
        Diminished Triad (1-b3-b5) :
            A diminished triad is the same as the minor but it also has a flat fifth.
            These triads instill a notion of confusion and don`t really have a defined emotion.

            For the C Diminished chord,
                we take the C major scale

                C D E F G A B C
                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

                and here we take First, Minor3rd (or b3) and Minor5th (or b5). 
                What the b3 means is that we take the half tone below the Major3rd, which in this case would be D#.
                What the b5 means is that we take the half tone below the Major5th, which in this case would be F#.
                C, D#, F# make up the C Diminished triad.

        Augmented Triad (1-3-#5) :
            A augmented triad is the same as the major but it also has a sharp fifth.

            For the C Augmented chord,
                we take the C major scale

                C D E F G A B C
                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

                and here we take First, Major3rd and Sharpened 5th (or #5). 
                What the #5 means is that we take the half tone above the Major5th, which in this case would be G#.
                C, D#, G# make up the C Augmented triad.

        Suspended Triads :
            The Sus 2 and the Sus 4 are the two most commonly used and they are both derived from the major triad by 
            replacing the Major3rd (or 3) with the second (Sus 2) or the fourth (Sus 4).

            Suspended 2 (1-2-5) :
                For the C Suspended 2 chord,
                    we take the C major scale

                    C D E F G A B C
                    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

                    and here we take First, Suspended 2 (or sus2) and Fifth. 
                    What the sus2 means is that we take the Second in the above scale, which in this case would be D.
                    C, D, G make up the C Suspended 2 triad.
            Suspended 4 (1-4-5) :
                For the C Suspended 4 chord,
                    we take the C major scale

                    C D E F G A B C
                    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

                    and here we take First, Suspended 4 (or sus4) and Fifth. 
                    What the sus2 means is that we take the Fourth in the above scale, which in this case would be F.
                    C, F, G make up the C Suspended 4 triad.

    Sevenths :
        These are the extended versions of the triads with an added note. This added note varies among the different
        types but have similar structure.

        Major Seventh (1-3-5-7) :
            A major seventh is the first, third, fifth adn seventh notes of the major scale of the root note.   

            For example:

            For the C major chord, 
                we take the C major scale

                C D E F G A B C
                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

                and take the root note, C then the third, the fifth and seventh relative to the root note which 
                are E, G and B. 
                C, E, G, B make up the C major seventh.

                Here the third is named and the Major third or Major3rd or 3.
        
        Minor Seventh (1-b3-5-b7) :
            A minor seventh is the first, third, fifth and seventh notes of the natural minor scale of the root note.
            But, to understand it using the major scale lets take an example,

            For the C Minor Seventh chord,
                we take the C major scale

                C D E F G A B C
                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

                and here we take First, Minor3rd (or b3), Fifth, Minor7th (or b7). 
                What the b3 means is that we take the half tone below the Major3rd, which in this case would be D#.
                What the b7 means is that we take the half tone below the Major7th, which in this case would be A# or Bb.
                C, D#, G, A# make up the C minor seventh.
        
        Half Diminished or Minor Seventh Flat 5th (1-b3-b5-b7) :
            A half diminished or Minor Seventh Flat 5th is the same as the minor seventh but it also has a flat fifth.

            For the C Half Diminished chord,
                we take the C major scale

                C D E F G A B C
                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

                and here we take First, Minor3rd (or b3), Minor5th (or b5), Minor7th (or b7).
                What the b3 means is that we take the half tone below the Major3rd, which in this case would be D#.
                What the b5 means is that we take the half tone below the Major5th, which in this case would be F#.
                What the b7 means is that we take the half tone below the Major7th, which in this case would be A# or Bb.
                C, D#, F#, A# make up the C Half Diminished.

        Dominant Seventh (1-3-5-b7) :
            A Dominant Seventh is the same as the major seventh but it also has a flat fifth.

            For the C Dominant Seventh chord,
                we take the C major scale

                C D E F G A B C
                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

                and here we take First, Major3rd and Minor7th (or b7). 
                What the b7 means is that we take the half tone below the Major7th, which in this case would be A# or Bb.
                C, E, G, A# make up the C Dominant Seventh.
